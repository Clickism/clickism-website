# Configuration
ClickMobs uses the YAML format for configuration.
If you don't know what YAML is, it might be helpful to look into some tutorials or quick guides online.

### Where to find the Configuration file?
You can find the `config.yml` file used for configuring the mod/plugin at:
1. **If you are on Fabric:**
- If you are using the mod on a **client**: `.minecraft/config/ClickMobs/config.yml`
    - _Warning: If you are using a custom client, i.E. Lunar or Modrinth, go to the corresponding installation directory instead of `.minecraft`._
- If you are using the mod on a **server**: `<server_directory>/config/ClickMobs/config.yml`

2. **If you are on Paper/Spigot:**
- Found at `.../plugins/ClickMobs/config.yml`
