# Getting Started
Configured is a format-independent configuration library for Java that allows you to generate
versioned and documented configuration files directly from code in multiple formats such as YAML,
JSON, and more.

It provides a simple and intuitive API to define configuration options, their default values,
and descriptions, which can be used to generate configuration files with comments and versioning.
